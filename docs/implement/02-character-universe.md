#### [ ] **Feature:** Implement Character Travel Trunk Creation and Management

*   **Context:** This focuses on building the core functionality for authors to create and manage the "Character Travel Trunk" for their original characters. This enables characters to be proposed for inclusion in other stories.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   [ ] Users must be able to create a "Travel Trunk" for a character they own.
    *   [ ] The "Travel Trunk" must include a narrative sample featuring the character and a link to the character's comprehensive bio page.
    *   [ ] Users must be able to edit and update the contents of the "Travel Trunk."
    *   [ ] The character's bio page (linked from the trunk) should include thematic interests, topical engagements, and preferences.
*   **Technical Approach:** Create new data models for Character Travel Trunks and character bios. Develop frontend forms for creating and editing trunks and bios. Implement backend endpoints for saving and retrieving trunk and bio data.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   [ ] An author can create a Character Travel Trunk for their character.
    *   [ ] The trunk includes a narrative sample and a valid link to the character's bio.
    *   [ ] Authors can update the trunk and bio information.
    *   [ ] The character bio page displays thematic interests, topics, and preferences.
*   [ ] **Notes/Considerations:** Define the structure and format for narrative samples and character bios. Consider how to handle links to bio pages within the platform.

#### [ ] **Feature:** Implement Character Travel Trunk Proposal System

*   **Context:** This involves building the system for authors to propose the inclusion of a character (via their Travel Trunk) into another author's story. This facilitates cross-narrative collaboration.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   [ ] An author must be able to initiate a proposal to the original author of a character (either directly or from the Casting Studio).
    *   [ ] The proposal should include details on how the inviting author envisions integrating the character into their novel.
    *   [ ] The original author must be able to review incoming proposals.
    *   [ ] The original author must be able to accept or reject a proposal.
    *   [ ] Upon acceptance, there should be an option for the original author to grant permissions and potentially initiate collaboration on the integration.
*   **Technical Approach:** Create data models for proposals. Develop frontend components for creating, viewing, and responding to proposals. Implement backend endpoints for managing the proposal lifecycle (creation, review, acceptance/rejection). Integrate with the permission system.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   [ ] An author can send a character integration proposal to another author.
    *   [ ] The original author receives and can view the proposal details.
    *   [ ] The original author can accept or reject the proposal.
    *   [ ] Accepting a proposal provides options for granting permissions and collaboration.
*   [ ] **Notes/Considerations:** Design a clear and intuitive user interface for the proposal process. Consider notification systems for new proposals and responses.
