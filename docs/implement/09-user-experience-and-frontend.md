*   **Assignees:** [Suggested Assignee(s)]

**Description:**

*   **Context:** This task focuses on implementing the core frontend layout and ensuring the application is responsive across various devices, adhering to the UX principles outlined in `vision-scope.md` and `product-plan.md`. This will be achieved using the Vuetify UI framework.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   [x] Implement the main layout structure using Nuxt.js 3, Vue.js, and Vuetify components.
    *   [x] Ensure the design is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using Vuetify's grid system and breakpoints.
    *   [x] Prioritize simplicity and intuitiveness in the UI implementation, leveraging Vuetify's pre-built components.
*   **Technical Approach:** Utilize Vuetify's layout components (e.g., `v-app`, `v-main`, `v-container`, `v-row`, `v-col`) and utility classes for building the responsive layout. Implement mobile-first or responsive design principles as guided by Vuetify's documentation.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   [x] The application layout is consistent and functional across different devices.
    *   [x] Key UI elements are easily accessible on various screen sizes.
    *   [x] The overall look and feel aligns with the desired user experience and utilizes Vuetify components.
*   **Notes/Considerations:** Refer to `docs/Vuetifying.md` for architecture decisions and implementation checklist. Pay close attention to touch interactions on mobile devices.

#### **Task Title:** Implement Core Navigation and Routing

*   **Labels:** `feature`, `frontend`, `UX`, `MVP1`
*   **Assignees:** [Suggested Assignee(s)]

**Description:**

*   **Context:** This task involves setting up the core navigation and routing for the application using Nuxt.js 3, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user flow as described in the UX principles in `vision-scope.md`.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   [x] Define the main application routes (e.g., home, user profile, novel view, casting studio, novel cafe).
    *   [x] Implement navigation components (e.g., header, sidebar) that allow users to easily move between different sections of the application.
    *   [x] Ensure routing is efficient and provides a good user experience.
*   **Technical Approach:** Utilize Nuxt.js 3 file-based routing or define custom routes. Implement navigation links and components using Vue Router within Nuxt.js.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   [x] Users can navigate to all main sections of the application.
    *   [x] Navigation is intuitive and easy to use.
    *   [x] Routing is performant.
*   **Notes/Considerations:** Consider nested routes and dynamic routing for specific content (e.g., individual novels, characters).
