#### **Task Title:** Implement Tiered Authorization System

*   **Labels:** `feature`, `backend`, `frontend`, `permissions`, `authorization`, `MVP1`
*   **Assignees:** [Suggested Assignee(s)]

**Description:**

*   **Context:** This task involves building the tiered authorization system with Admin, Moderator, and Creator roles, as described in `vision-scope.md` and the "Authorization and Moderation" section of `functional-spec.md`.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   [ ] Define the capabilities and permissions for each role (Admin, Moderator, Creator).
    *   [ ] Implement backend logic to enforce role-based access control for all relevant actions.
    *   [ ] Provide an interface for assigning roles to users (initially, likely by an Admin or system).
*   **Technical Approach:** Design a role-based access control (RBAC) model in the database. Implement backend middleware or decorators to protect routes and functions based on user roles. Develop frontend components to reflect user roles and available actions.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   [ ] Users are assigned roles (Admin, Moderator, Creator).
    *   [ ] The backend correctly enforces permissions based on user roles.
    *   [ ] User interface elements are enabled/disabled based on the user's role.
*   **Notes/Considerations:** Clearly define the permissions for each role based on the functional specification.

#### **Task Title:** Implement Student Account Moderation Workflow

*   **Labels:** `feature`, `backend`, `frontend`, `moderation`, `education`, `MVP1`
*   **Assignees:** [Suggested Assignee(s)]

**Description:**

*   **Context:** This task focuses on implementing the specific moderation workflow for Student accounts, requiring approval from a Moderating teacher and optionally other collaborators, as detailed in `vision-scope.md` and the "Authorization and Moderation" section of `functional-spec.md`.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   [ ] Identify accounts as "Student" accounts (likely during creation by a teacher).
    *   [ ] Implement a submission and approval process for content created by Student accounts.
    *   [ ] The workflow must involve approval from a designated Moderating teacher.
    *   [ ] Include an option for requiring approval from other authors involved in a collaboration.
    *   [ ] Provide interfaces for students to submit content and for moderators/collaborators to review and approve/reject submissions.
*   **Technical Approach:** Add a flag or role to identify Student accounts. Create data models for submissions and approvals. Implement backend endpoints for submitting content, reviewing submissions, and recording approval decisions. Develop frontend components for the submission and review process.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   [ ] Content created by Student accounts requires approval.
    *   [ ] The designated Moderating teacher can review and approve/reject submissions.
    *   [ ] Optional approval from collaborators is enforced when configured.
    *   [ ] Students and moderators have clear interfaces for the workflow.
*   **Notes/Considerations:** Define the types of content that require moderation (e.g., new novels, major changes). Design clear notifications for pending submissions and approval decisions.
