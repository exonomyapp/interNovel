### Feature Category: Collaborative Novel Structure

#### **Feature:** Implement Novel Spine and Vertebrae Creation

*   **Context:** This focuses on building the core functionality of the "Novel Spine," allowing authors to structure their stories using "Vertebrae" representing ideas and plot points.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   [ ] Authors must be able to create a "Novel Spine" for their novel.
    *   [ ] Authors must be able to add "Vertebrae" to the Spine, representing ideas, plot points, or thematic elements.
    *   [ ] Each Vertebra should have a title and a description field for detailed notes or snippets.
*   **Technical Approach:** Create data models for Novel Spines and Vertebrae. Develop frontend components for creating and managing Spines and Vertebrae. Implement backend endpoints for saving and retrieving Spine and Vertebrae data.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   [ ] An author can create a Novel Spine for their novel.
    *   [ ] An author can add new Vertebrae to the Spine.
    *   [ ] Vertebrae can store a title and description.
*   [ ] **Notes/Considerations:** Consider the initial structure of the Spine and how Vertebrae will be ordered by default.

#### **Feature:** Implement Manual Time Stamping for Vertebrae

*   **Context:** This involves adding the ability to manually time stamp Vertebrae within the Novel Spine to establish an underlying chronological framework.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   [ ] Authors must be able to manually assign a time stamp to each Vertebra.
    *   [ ] The platform should store and maintain the chronological order based on these time stamps.
    *   [ ] The time stamps should be editable.
*   **Technical Approach:** Add a timestamp field to the Vertebra data model. Develop frontend controls for inputting and editing time stamps. Implement backend logic to store and retrieve time stamps.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   [ ] An author can assign a manual time stamp to a Vertebra.
    *   [ ] The platform stores the assigned time stamp.
    *   [ ] Authors can edit existing time stamps.
*   [ ] **Notes/Considerations:** Define the format and precision of the manual time stamp. Consider how to handle potential conflicts or ambiguities in time stamping.

#### **Feature:** Implement Tagging and Categorization of Vertebrae

*   **Context:** This focuses on enabling authors to tag Vertebrae with themes and topics for organization and analysis.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   [ ] Authors must be able to define custom themes and topics.
    *   [ ] Authors must be able to associate one or more themes and topics with each Vertebra.
    *   [ ] The platform should store these associations.
*   **Technical Approach:** Create data models for Themes and Topics and a many-to-many relationship between Vertebrae and Themes/Topics. Develop frontend components for managing themes/topics and tagging Vertebrae. Implement backend endpoints for managing themes/topics and associations.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   [ ] An author can create new themes and topics.
    *   [ ] An author can tag a Vertebra with existing themes and topics.
    *   [ ] The platform stores the theme and topic associations for each Vertebra.
*   [ ] **Notes/Considerations:** Consider how themes and topics will be managed globally vs. per novel.

#### **Feature:** Implement Visual Overview and Dynamic Arrangement of Novel Spine

*   **Context:** This task focuses on developing a visual representation of the novel's spine, allowing authors to intuitively understand and manipulate the narrative flow.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   [ ] The platform must display a visual overview of the Novel Spine, showing the order and relationships of Vertebrae.
    *   [ ] Authors should be able to dynamically rearrange Vertebrae within the visual interface.
    *   [ ] The visual representation should reflect time stamps and tags.
*   **Technical Approach:** Utilize a suitable frontend library for interactive diagrams or graphs (e.g., D3.js, Vue Flow). Implement drag-and-drop functionality for rearranging Vertebrae. Develop logic to render Vertebrae based on their time stamps and tags.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   [ ] A visual representation of the Novel Spine is displayed.
    *   [ ] Authors can rearrange Vertebrae using drag-and-drop.
    *   [ ] The visual overview accurately reflects time stamps and tags.
*   [ ] **Notes/Considerations:** Optimize for performance with a large number of Vertebrae. Consider different layout options for the visual overview.
