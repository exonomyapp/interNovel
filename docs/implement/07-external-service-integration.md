### Task Category: External Service Integration

#### **Task Title:** Implement OAuth 2.0 Integration Framework

*   **Labels:** `feature`, `backend`, `authentication`, `integration`, `MVP1`
*   **Assignees:** [Suggested Assignee(s)]

**Description:**

*   **Context:** This task involves building a flexible framework for integrating with external third-party services using OAuth 2.0, as described in `product-plan.md` and `vision-scope.md`, and the "Technical Overhead & External Service Integration" section of `functional-spec.md`. This is essential for document storage and leveraging external resources.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   [ ] Implement a generic OAuth 2.0 flow that can be configured for different service providers.
    *   [ ] Securely store access tokens and refresh tokens.
    *   [ ] Provide backend endpoints for initiating the OAuth flow and handling callbacks.
*   **Technical Approach:** Utilize an OAuth 2.0 library or framework in the backend. Design a database schema for storing connection information. Implement secure handling of sensitive token data.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   [ ] The platform can initiate an OAuth 2.0 flow with a configured service provider.
    *   [ ] Access and refresh tokens are securely stored upon successful authorization.
    *   [ ] The backend can handle OAuth callbacks.
*   **Notes/Considerations:** Research and prioritize which external services to integrate first (e.g., GitHub, Google Docs). Implement robust error handling for the OAuth flow.

#### **Task Title:** Implement Document Storage Integration (e.g., GitHub)

*   **Labels:** `feature`, `backend`, `frontend`, `integration`, `document-storage`, `MVP1`
*   **Assignees:** [Suggested Assignee(s)]

**Description:**

*   **Context:** This task focuses on implementing integration with a specific document storage service (e.g., GitHub) using the OAuth 2.0 framework, allowing users to store their novel text files externally, as described in `product-plan.md`, `vision-scope.md`, and `functional-spec.md`.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   [ ] Users must be able to connect their account from the chosen service (e.g., GitHub) via OAuth 2.0.
    *   [ ] The platform must be able to read and write novel text files to the user's connected storage.
    *   [ ] Abstract the technical complexity of external storage from the user.
*   **Technical Approach:** Utilize the implemented OAuth 2.0 framework. Use the service provider's API (e.g., GitHub API) to interact with user files. Develop backend services to handle file operations and frontend components for user interaction.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   [ ] A user can connect their chosen document storage account.
    *   [ ] The platform can successfully read and write novel files to the external storage.
    *   [ ] The user experience for saving and loading is seamless.
*   **Notes/Considerations:** Handle different file formats and potential API rate limits. Consider versioning and conflict resolution when saving files externally.
