# Internovel Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing the features described in the functional specification, guided by the project vision and product plan.

## 1. Timelines and Milestones

This section will define the key dates and milestones for the implementation process.

*   **Start Date:** 
*   **End Date (Target):** 

**Key Milestones:**

*   [ ] **Milestone 1:** Core DID Integration - Target Completion: 
*   [ ] **Milestone 2:** Character Management - Target Completion: 
*   [ ] **Milestone 3:** Novel Structure Features - Target Completion: 

## 4. Bug Fixes and Maintenance

This section tracks bug fixes and maintenance tasks performed on the platform.

### Vuetify Plugin Errors

*   **Context:** The `plugins/vuetify.ts` file had errors related to the `defineNuxtPlugin` function and the `nuxtApp` parameter type.
*   **Resolution:**
    *   Added the correct import for `defineNuxtPlugin` from `#app`.
    *   Added the `NuxtApp` type to the `nuxtApp` parameter.

### Supabase Client Import Error

*   **Context:** The `stores/auth.ts` file had an error with the import of `useSupabaseClient`.
*   **Resolution:** Changed the import to a default import.

### TSConfig Errors

*   **Context:** The `tsconfig.json` file was showing errors because the files it was extending were not found.
*   **Resolution:** Ran `npm install` to trigger `nuxt prepare` and generate the necessary files in the `.nuxt` directory.

## 4. Technology Stack

-   **Frontend:** Nuxt.js (Vue.js 3), Vuetify 3
-   **Backend:** Nuxt.js 3 server-side capabilities
-   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) and OrbitDB in tandem for resilient content hosting. Write operations prioritize local Helia OrbitDB then trigger Supabase. Read operations attempt Supabase first with fallback to OrbitDB.
-   **Authentication:** Custom DID-based authentication
-   **Version Control:** Git/GitHub for collaborative writing and document management

## 5. Deployment

-   **Hosting:** Vercel (for frontend), Supabase (for backend and database)
-   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

## 6. Milestones

-   **Milestone 1:** Core DID Integration and basic Character Management.
-   **Milestone 2:** Advanced Character Features and initial Novel Structure functionality.
-   **Milestone 3:** Full Novel Structure and deployment readiness.

This plan is subject to change based on feedback and development progress.

## 6. Future Considerations
