### Task Category: Collaborative Writing Environment

#### **Task Title:** Implement Core Text Editing Functionality

*   **Labels:** `feature`, `frontend`, `writing-environment`, `MVP1`
*   **Assignees:** [Suggested Assignee(s)]

**Description:**

*   **Context:** This task focuses on building the fundamental text editing capabilities within the collaborative writing environment, as described in `vision-scope.md` and the "Intuitive Collaborative Writing Environment" section of `functional-spec.md`. This will involve integrating a rich text editor and potentially using Vuetify components for the editor's UI elements.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   [ ] Provide a rich text editing area for writing novel content.
    *   [ ] Include basic formatting options (e.g., bold, italics, headings), potentially using Vuetify components for toolbars and controls.
    *   [ ] Allow authors to associate text content with specific Vertebrae or sections from the Novel Spine.
*   **Technical Approach:** Integrate a rich text editor library (e.g., TipTap, Quill). Develop frontend components to connect the editor with the Novel Spine structure and data models. Utilize Vuetify components for the editor's interface elements where appropriate.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   [ ] Authors can write and format text within the editor.
    *   [ ] Text content can be linked to specific Vertebrae or sections.
    *   [ ] Editor UI elements (if using Vuetify) are functional and consistent with the overall theme.
*   **Notes/Considerations:** Consider real-time collaboration requirements when choosing and implementing the editor. Refer to `docs/Vuetifying.md` for guidance on using Vuetify components.

#### **Task Title:** Implement Simplified Real-Time Collaboration and Awareness

*   **Labels:** `feature`, `backend`, `frontend`, `collaboration`, `real-time`, `MVP1`
*   **Assignees:** [Suggested Assignee(s)]

**Description:**

*   **Context:** This task involves implementing the simplified real-time collaboration features for MVP1, including presence indicators, near real-time updates, and activity notifications, as outlined in `vision-scope.md` and the "Intuitive Collaborative Writing Environment" section of `functional-spec.md`.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   [ ] Users collaborating on the same novel should see who else is currently active.
    *   [ ] Changes made by one collaborator should appear to others in near real-time.
    *   [ ] Users should receive notifications about important activities (e.g., a collaborator joining, a major change saved).
    *   [ ] Implement a follow/subscription feature for novels and characters.
*   **Technical Approach:** Utilize WebSockets or a similar real-time communication technology. Implement backend services to broadcast changes and notifications. Develop frontend components to display presence indicators and handle incoming updates and notifications.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   [ ] Users can see other active collaborators.
    *   [ ] Content updates are reflected quickly for all collaborators.
    *   [ ] Users receive relevant activity notifications.
    *   [ ] Users can follow/subscribe to novels and characters and receive updates.
*   **Notes/Considerations:** Define "near real-time" and manage potential conflicts in concurrent editing (simplified for MVP1). Design a clear and unobtrusive notification system.

#### **Task Title:** Implement Granular Permission System

*   **Labels:** `feature`, `backend`, `permissions`, `MVP1`
*   **Assignees:** [Suggested Assignee(s)]

**Description:**

*   **Context:** This task focuses on building the granular permission system that allows authors to control access to their works, as described in `vision-scope.md` and the "Intuitive Collaborative Writing Environment" section of `functional-spec.md`.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   [ ] Authors must be able to define different permission levels for collaborators (e.g., read-only, editor, administrator).
    *   [ ] Permissions should be applicable at different levels (e.g., the entire novel, specific sections, individual Vertebrae).
    *   [ ] The backend must enforce these permissions for all actions.
    *   [ ] The frontend should reflect the user's permissions.
*   **Technical Approach:** Design a robust permission model in the database. Implement backend middleware or logic to check permissions before executing actions. Develop frontend components to manage permissions and adjust the UI based on the current user's permissions.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   [ ] Authors can set granular permissions for collaborators.
    *   [ ] The backend correctly enforces defined permissions.
    *   [ ] The frontend UI reflects the user's access level.
*   **Notes/Considerations:** Define the different permission levels and their corresponding capabilities. Ensure the permission system is flexible enough to accommodate future needs.
