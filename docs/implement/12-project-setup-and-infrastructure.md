#### **Task Title:** Set up Nuxt.js 3 Project and Dependencies

*   **Labels:** `infrastructure`, `frontend`, `backend`, `setup`, `MVP1`
*   **Assignees:** [Suggested Assignee(s)]

**Description:**

*   **Context:** This foundational task involves setting up the core Nuxt.js 3 project and installing necessary dependencies for both frontend and backend development, as indicated by the use of Nuxt.js 3 in `product-plan.md` and `vision-scope.md`.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   [x] Initialize a new Nuxt.js 3 project.
    *   [x] Install core dependencies (Vue.js, Pinia).
    *   [x] Install backend dependencies (e.g., for database interaction, authentication).
    *   [x] Configure basic project settings.
*   **Technical Approach:** Use the Nuxt.js CLI to create the project. Use npm or yarn to install dependencies. Configure `nuxt.config.ts`.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   [x] A functional Nuxt.js 3 project is set up.
    *   [x] Core frontend and backend dependencies are installed.
    *   [x] The project can be run locally.
*   **Notes/Considerations:** Choose between JavaScript and TypeScript (TypeScript is used in existing files).

#### **Task Title:** Configure Supabase Integration

*   **Labels:** `infrastructure`, `backend`, `database`, `setup`, `MVP1`
*   **Assignees:** [Suggested Assignee(s)]

**Description:**
