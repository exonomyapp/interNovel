This section details the implementation of Internovel's core features, focusing on collaborative writing and content management.

### Feature Category: Decentralized Identity

#### **Feature:** Implement DID Generation and Management

*   **Context:** This involves implementing the core functionality for users to generate and manage their Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) within the Internovel platform. This is fundamental for enabling immutable attribution of creative contributions.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Users must be able to generate a `did:key` upon account creation or in their profile settings.
    *   The platform must securely store the encrypted private keys in the user's browser using IndexedDB.
    *   Provide a user interface for managing their DID, including viewing the public DID.
    *   Ensure the implementation adheres to W3C DID specifications for the `did:key` method.
*   **Technical Approach:** Utilize the Web Crypto API for key generation and cryptographic operations. Implement secure storage mechanisms using IndexedDB. Develop frontend components for user interaction and backend logic for handling DID-related operations.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A new user can successfully generate a DID.
    *   The generated DID is a valid `did:key`.
    *   The encrypted private key is securely stored in IndexedDB.

*   **Technical Approach:** 
    *   Backend endpoints for issuing challenges and verifying signatures
    *   Frontend logic using Web Crypto API for signing
    *   Integration with JWT token issuance
    *   Implemented in `useDidAuth.ts` composable with:
        *   `createChallenge()` - Generates random challenge
        *   `signChallenge()` - Signs with private key from `useDid`
        *   `verifySignature()` - Verifies using public key
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A user can successfully log in using their DID.
    *   The authentication process utilizes a challenge-response mechanism.
    *   Challenges are single-use and time-limited

#### **Feature:** Implement Cryptographic Linking of Contributions to DID

*   **Context:** This is crucial for ensuring immutable attribution of creative contributions by cryptographically linking them to the author's DID. This is fundamental for enabling immutable attribution of creative contributions.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   When a user makes a contribution (e.g., adding a paragraph, defining a character element), the contribution data must be signed by the user's private key.
    *   The signature and the user's DID must be stored alongside the contribution data in the database.
    *   The platform must be able to verify the signature using the author's public DID to confirm the contribution's authenticity and origin.
*   **Technical Approach:** Modify the data models to include fields for DID and signature. Implement backend logic to handle the signing process before saving contributions and verification when retrieving or displaying contributions. Develop frontend components to facilitate the signing process (potentially transparent to the user).
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Every creative contribution is associated with the author's DID and a valid cryptographic signature.
    *   The platform can verify the signature of a contribution using the author's public DID.
    *   Attribution information (linked to the DID) is displayed for each contribution.
*   [ ] **Notes/Considerations:** Determine the granularity of contributions to be signed (e.g., per paragraph, per section). Consider the performance implications of signing and verifying contributions.

### Feature Category: Character Universe Management

    *   Implement endpoints for handling external service integration (OAuth callbacks, file operations).
    *   Implement endpoints for moderation workflows.
*   **Technical Approach:** Utilize Nuxt.js 3 server routes to define API endpoints. Implement logic within these endpoints to interact with the database (using Drizzle ORM) and external services.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   All necessary API endpoints for MVP1 features are implemented.
    *   Endpoints correctly interact with the database and external services.
    *   Endpoints are protected by appropriate authentication and authorization checks.
*   **Notes/Considerations:** Design a consistent API structure and naming convention. Implement input validation and error handling.

### Task Category: Intellectual Property Management

#### **Task Title:** Implement Basic IP Attribution Display

*   **Labels:** `feature`, `frontend`, `attribution`, `IP`, `MVP1`
*   **Assignees:** [Suggested Assignee(s)]

**Description:**

*   **Context:** This task involves displaying the attribution information linked to the author's DID for each contribution, laying the foundation for intellectual property management as described in `product-plan.md` and the "Intellectual Property (IP) Clarity" section of `functional-spec.md`.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Retrieve the author's DID associated with each contribution.
