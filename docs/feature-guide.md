# InterNovel Feature Guide

This document outlines proposals to address the core problems in collaborative writing, aligning them with the user experience principles for InterNovel MVP1.

## 1. Fair Attribution

**Problem:** Ensuring each contributor receives clear and undeniable credit for their specific inputs.

**Proposal:** Implement a DID-based attribution system where all creative contributions (paragraphs, character elements, plot points) are cryptographically linked to the author's DID.

*   **Details:**
    *   Use W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to anchor user identities.
    *   Cryptographically sign contributions with the author's DID.
    *   Display attribution information clearly and transparently within the platform.
*   **UX Principles:** Clarity, Simplicity & Intuitiveness
*   **Notes for Developers:** Integrate with the existing DID management system.

## 2. Intellectual Property (IP) Clarity

**Problem:** Defining and protecting ownership rights in a multi-author environment.

**Proposal:** Develop a DID-based licensing framework that allows authors to define and manage the usage rights for their creative assets.

*   **Details:**
    *   Allow authors to specify licensing terms for their contributions (e.g., Creative Commons, proprietary).
    *   Use DIDs to track and enforce licensing agreements.
    *   Provide tools for resolving IP disputes.
*   **UX Principles:** Clarity, Flexibility
*   **Notes for Developers:** Research existing DID-based licensing standards.

## 3. Non-Linear Idea Development

**Problem:** Supporting the often non-sequential way authors develop story ideas and narrative arcs.

**Proposal:** Enhance the "Novel Spine" feature to allow authors to capture and organize ideas in a non-linear manner while maintaining an underlying chronological framework.

*   **Details:**
    *   Allow authors to create "Vertebrae" representing core ideas, plot points, or thematic elements.
    *   Enable manual time stamping of Vertebrae to establish an inherent chronological sequence.
    *   Enable tagging and categorization of Vertebrae with relevant themes and topics.
    *   Provide a visual overview of the Novel Spine, allowing authors to rearrange Vertebrae and experiment with different storylines, while the time stamps provide a reference for the original chronological order. This allows authors to creatively conceal or reveal the cause and effect sequence in the final presentation.
*   **UX Principles:** Flexibility, Engagement, Clarity
*   **Notes for Developers:** Integrate manual time stamping functionality with the existing Novel Spine feature and ensure the visual overview clearly displays both the arranged order and the underlying chronological order based on time stamps.

## 4. Structural & Thematic Cohesion

**Problem:** Managing the overall structure (e.g., sections, acts) and maintaining thematic consistency across multiple contributors and evolving narratives.

**Proposal:** Develop tools for defining and managing narrative structure, including sections (e.g., chapters, acts), and for associating and visualizing themes and topics across the novel.

*   **Details:**
    *   Allow authors to define sections and associate them with specific Vertebrae in the Novel Spine.
    *   Provide tools for visualizing the thematic distribution across the novel.
    *   Enable authors to track and manage thematic consistency across multiple contributions.
*   **UX Principles:** Clarity, Engagement
*   **Notes for Developers:** Integrate with the Novel Spine and thematic tagging features.

## 5. Discoverability & Organic Collaboration

**Problem:** Enabling authors to find fitting collaborators or allow their creative assets (like characters and novels) to be discovered and integrated into new narratives.

**Proposal:** Enhance the "Casting Studio" and "Novel Café" features to facilitate character and novel discovery and collaboration.

*   **Details:**
    *   Improve the search and filtering capabilities of the Casting Studio and Novel Café.
    *   Implement recommendation algorithms to suggest relevant characters and novels to authors.
    *   Provide tools for authors to express their desire for collaborators on specific novels.
*   **UX Principles:** Engagement, Simplicity & Intuitiveness
*   **Notes for Developers:** Implement recommendation algorithms and improve search functionality.

## 6. Accessibility for Young Creators

**Problem:** Providing tools that are powerful yet not overwhelmingly technical for emerging writers.

**Proposal:** Prioritize simplicity and intuitiveness in the design of all features, abstracting technical complexities and providing clear explanations.

*   **Details:**
    *   Use a visually appealing and interactive environment.
    *   Provide clear explanations of all features, especially those related to IP, contributions, structure, and themes.
    *   Offer tutorials and help resources for new users.
*   **UX Principles:** Simplicity & Intuitiveness, Clarity
*   **Notes for Developers:** Focus on user-friendly design and clear documentation.

## 7. Character Portability & Cross-Narrative Potential

**Problem:** Enabling characters to organically exist and evolve across different stories and authorial domains.

**Proposal:** Further develop the "Character Travel trunk" concept to facilitate character portability and cross-narrative potential.

*   **Details:**
    *   Allow authors to define detailed character bios, thematic preferences, and writing samples.
    *   Provide tools for managing character permissions and licensing.
    *   Enable authors to track the usage of their characters in other stories.
*   **UX Principles:** Flexibility, Engagement
*   **Notes for Developers:** Integrate with the DID-based attribution and licensing systems.

## 8. Technical Overhead

**Problem:** Managing version control, document storage, and collaborative permissions can be cumbersome.

**Proposal:** Streamline document management and external service integration, providing users with a seamless experience.

*   **Details:**
    *   Allow users to connect their accounts from third-party services (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Google Docs) to store the actual text files of their novels.
    *   Use OAuth 2.0 (or equivalent secure protocols) to allow users to grant the platform permission to interact with these chosen services on their behalf.
    *   Abstract the complexity of external service integration from the user.
*   **UX Principles:** Simplicity & Intuitiveness, Clarity
*   **Notes for Developers:** Implement OAuth 2.0 integration with popular document storage services.
