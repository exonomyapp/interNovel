## Vuetify Theming Implementation

**Note:** Vuetify has been temporarily removed from the project to address TypeScript compatibility issues. It will be reinstalled and reconfigured in a future session. The original documentation is preserved below for reference.

### Theme Configuration
1. **Color System** (`plugins/vuetify.ts`)
   - Primary/secondary color definitions
   - Dark/light theme variants
   - Component default overrides

2. **Layout Constants** (`constants/display.ts`)
   - Responsive breakpoints
   - Standard spacing units
   - Grid configurations

### Current Implementation Status
- Using Vuetify exclusively for theme variables
- Leveraging built-in component styling
- Minimal custom CSS overrides

### Maintenance Guidelines
- Update theme colors as needed
- Add new constants for layout requirements
- Document any component-specific overrides
