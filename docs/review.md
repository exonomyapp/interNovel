# Code Review

## Overview

This review synthesizes the project's documentation and codebase to identify inconsistencies and areas for improvement.

## Key Findings

1.  **UI Framework Mismatch:** `package.json` and `nuxt.config.ts` included dependencies for both Vuetify and Tailwind CSS. The `docs/todo.md` file detailed a planned migration to Vuetify, which was incomplete. While the examined Vue components use Vuetify, the Tailwind CSS dependency persisted, creating a hybrid environment that complicated development and maintenance. This has been resolved by removing Tailwind CSS from the project.

2.  **Incomplete DID Implementation:** The `stores/did.ts` file is a placeholder. It lacks the core cryptographic functionalities for DID generation and management as described in `implementation-plan.md` and other documents.

3.  **Outdated Documentation:** `changelog.md` and `todo.md` are outdated and do not reflect the current state of the project.

## Recommendations

1.  **Implement DID Functionality:** Flesh out the `useDidStore` in `stores/did.ts` to include the necessary cryptographic functions for DID creation, resolution, and management.

2.  **Update Documentation:** After the DID implementation is complete, update all relevant documentation to reflect the changes. This includes `changelog.md`, and any other documents that are currently out of sync.
