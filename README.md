# Internovel

Internovel is a collaborative writing platform designed to revolutionize the way authors create, share, and maintain ownership of their creative work.

Imagine a space where writers can seamlessly collaborate on novels, scripts, and other creative projects, all while retaining clear attribution and intellectual property rights. Internovel provides a suite of tools for real-time collaboration, version control, and content management, fostering a vibrant community of authors and readers.

Just as GitHub revolutionized collaborative coding, Internovel aims to do the same for collaborative creative writing. By leveraging GitHub as its backend, Internovel extends the repository for managing the content of every novel. GitHub issues function as writing tasks, leveraging all of GitHub's features for delegating writing tasks to collaborators.

Internovel offers authors a unique set of capabilities:

- **Character Universe Management:** Internovel facilitates collections of characters, themes, and topics for every author, outside of GitHub and within a Supabase instance. These collections can conveniently traverse novels and authors, creating a shared universe of creative elements.
- **Social Media-Inspired Collaboration:** Inspired by social media dynamics, Internovel allows authors to create characters that they might like to introduce to other authors. These characters aren't brand new creations but have appearances in other novels, even novels that belong to other authors, bringing characters to life by allowing them to "literally" jump off the pages of the story they're in and make various kinds of appearances and play various roles throughout the Internovel network, just like a film star who pops up in many films, some of which are sequels, and in others there's only a cameo. It's all up to the authors.
- **AI-Powered Plot Recommendations:** Internovel's AI features load the character's context by retrieving content of appearances in parts of other stories that might be relevant to a new project and then recommends plot options for character injection into other projects.

Join us in building the future of collaborative writing!
